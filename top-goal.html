    <h1>Top goal</h1>
    <p>
      Every day things come at you. Emails, chat notifications, requests from
      co-workers. All 'important', all vying for attention. If one allows their
      attention to be focused on the items coming in, they won't make progrss on
      the most important things.
    </p>
    <p>
      The solution to this problem is to follow the practice of setting a 'Top
      Goal' for each day. At the end of each working day, I review my task list
      and calendar for the next day. From that list I choose a task that will
      have the greatest impact towards what I want to achieve. The next day, I
      spend the first 30 minuutes to an hour working on that task.
    </p>
    <p>
      Following this will create space to work on the things that matter, rather
      than getting caught up in the day to day activities.
